## Optimizing Renewables and Storage Through Intelligent Forecasting

Zentus is a renewable energy technology company focused on building intelligent forecasting systems that maximize revenue from renewable trading and operations. Supported by the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Accelerator, we combine deep energy domain expertise with advanced AI to solve critical challenges in high-wind energy markets.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We develop physics-informed machine learning models that are optimized for market impact, not just accuracy metrics. Our goal is to help renewable energy operators and traders make better decision    s during periods of high volatility, ultimately improving profitability and grid stability.

## 🌍 The Challenge We Address

Energy markets with high renewable penetration (ERCOT, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Nordics, etc.) face increasing intraday price volatility. Traders and operators struggle with:

- Timing storage dispatches and cycling decisions
- Avoiding negative price periods
- Choosing between day-ahead, real-time, and ancillary markets
- Predicting extreme price hours where true trading value lies

Conventional forecasting models minimize statistical error (RMSE) rather than financial outcomes, missing the true value drivers in energy trading.

## 💡 Our Solution

We co-develop and validate forecasting models through a four-stage process:

1. **Data Integration**: Combine market and operational data with physical insights
2. **AI Modelling**: Build adaptive forecasting systems using physics-informed ML
3. **Trading Decisions**: Enable optimal operational choices
4. **P&L Improvement**: Quantify and capture value

Our pilot-first collaboration approach ensures rapid validation, iterative refinement, and measurable outcomes for partners.

## 🔬 Technical Expertise
